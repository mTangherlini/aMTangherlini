I'm a microbial ecologist, investigating prokaryotic and viral diversity, abundance and dynamics in different marine ecosystems, from coastal to deep-sea sediments and from polluted to natural extreme ecosystems. To do so, I'm utilizing both lab-based and computational approaches, including metabarcoding (for profiling prokaryotic and micro-eukaryotic diversity) and metagenomics (to reconstruct and characterize prokaryotic and viral genomes).
