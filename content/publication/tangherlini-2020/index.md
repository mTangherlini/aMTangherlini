abstract: Chemical contamination of marine ecosystems represents a major concern for
  the detrimental consequences at different levels of biological organization. However,
  the impact of chronic contamination on the diversity and assemblage composition
  of benthic prokaryotes is still largely unknown, and this limits our understanding
  of the potential implications on ecosystem functioning. The Bagnoli-Coroglio bay
  (Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea) is a typical example of coastal area heavily contaminated
  by metals and hydrocarbons, released for decades by industrial activities, which
  ceased at the beginning of nineties. In the present study we analyzed the abundance,
  diversity and assemblage composition of benthic prokaryotic assemblages at increasing
  distance from the historical source of contamination in relation to the heavy hydrocarbons
  (C textgreater 12), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metal concentrations
  in the sediments. Prokaryotic abundance in the sediments differed among sites, and
  was mostly driven by environmental factors rather than by contamination levels.
  Conversely, the richness of prokaryotic taxa was relatively high in all samples,
  was driven by contamination levels and decreased significantly with increasing contamination
  (15â€“38%). Moreover, our results indicate large variations in the composition of
  the benthic prokaryotic assemblages among sites, mostly explained by the different
  levels and types of chemical contaminants found in the sediments. Overall, our findings
  suggest that chemical contaminants, even after decades from the end of their release,
  can profoundly influence the richness and turnover diversity of the benthic prokaryotic
  assemblages, in turn promoting a high diversification of the benthic bacterial and
  archaeal assemblages by selecting those lineages more adapted to specific mixtures
  of different contaminants. Our results open new perspectives for understanding of
  the long-term effects of chemical contamination on the benthic prokaryotic assemblages
  and the ecological processes they mediate.
