abstract: Submarine canyons are able to preferentially channel primary production
  and shelf export to the deep ocean, thus acting as hotspots of biomass and biogeochemical
  cycling of organic matter. Despite their global relevance, no information is available
  about the influence of submarine canyons on deep-sea virus-prokaryote interactions.
  Here, we show that deep-sea waters overlying the Bisagno Canyon (Ligurian Sea, NW
  Mediterranean) can sustain up to 4 times higher abundances of bathypelagic prokaryotes
  and viruses when compared to the waters overlying the adjacent slope. We also report
  that the bathypelagic waters of the canyon are hotspots of viral infections, with
  rates of virus-induced prokaryotic mortality and biomass turnover up to 10 times
  faster compared to the adjacent slope at similar depths. In addition, C released
  by viral lysis of their prokaryotic hosts in bathypelagic waters of the canyon was
  up to 40 times higher than in the slope. The prokaryotic distribution in bathypelagic
  waters of the investigated area of the Ligurian margin was largely influenced by
  organic C concentrations and temperature. Our results highlight that the peculiar
  characteristics of the canyons (such as the Bisagno canyon) could contribute to
  sustain the metabolism of bathypelagic prokaryotes, promoting C cycling through
  virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We conclude that submarine canyons could represent
  hot spots of prokaryotic and viral activities able to support the deep-sea pelagic
  food webs.
