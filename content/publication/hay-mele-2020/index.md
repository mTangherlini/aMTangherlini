abstract: Pollutants alter marine systems, interfering with provisioning of ecosystem
  services; understanding their interaction with ecological communities is therefore
  critical to inform environmental management. Here we propose a joint compositional-
  and interaction-based analysis for ecological status assessment and apply it on
  the benthic communities of the Bagnoli Bay. We found that contamination differentially
  affects the communities' composition in the bay, with prokaryotes influenced only
  by depth, and benthos not following the environmental gradient at all. This result
  is confirmed by analyses of the community structure, whose network structure suggest
  fast carbon flow and cycling, especially promoted by nematodes and polychaetes;
  the benthic prey/predator biomass ratio, adjusted for competition, successfully
  synthesise the status of predator taxa. We found demersal fish communities to separate
  into a deep, pelagic-like community, and two shallow communities where a shift from
  exclusive predators to omnivores occurs, moving from the most polluted to the least
  polluted sampling units. Finally, our study indicate that indices based on interspecific
  interactions are better indicators of environmental gradients than those defined
  based on species composition exclusively.
