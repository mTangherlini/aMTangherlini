abstract: Hadal trenches are among the most remote and least explored ecosystems on
  Earth and can support high benthic microbial standing stocks and activities. However,
  information on the role of viruses in such ecosystems and their interactions with
  prokaryotic hosts is very limited. Here, we investigated activities of benthic viruses
  and prokaryotes and their interactions in three hadal trenches (Japan, Izu-Ogasawara
  and Mariana trenches) and in their nearby abyssal sites. Our findings reveal that
  these hadal trenches, compared with the surrounding abyssal sites, support higher
  abundances and biomasses of prokaryotes. In addition, the high prokaryotic biomasses
  of hadal trenches could favor high rates of viral infection and cell lysis, especially
  in the Japan Trench. Hadal viruses can release large amounts of highly labile and
  promptly available organic material by inducing cell lysis, which could contribute
  to sustain benthic prokaryotes and decrease their dependency on the enzymatic digestion
  of the more refractory fraction of sediment organic matter. Our results suggest
  that this process can contribute to explain the discrepancy between high prokaryote
  biomass and apparent low efficiency in the utilization of the sedimentary organic
  matter in the hadal ecosystems. Concluding, hadal trenches may be characterized
  by a highly dynamic viral component, which can boost prokaryotic biomass production,
  thereby profoundly influencing the functioning of these remote and extreme ecosystems.
