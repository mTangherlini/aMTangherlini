abstract: Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) of the Mediterranean Sea are among
  the most extreme ecosystems on Earth and host abundant, active and diversified prokaryotic
  assemblages. However, factors influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
  are still largely unknown. We investigated, for the first time, the impact of viruses
  on the prokaryotic assemblages and dynamics of extracellular DNA pool in the sediments
  of La Medee, the largest DHAB found on Earth. We also compared, in La Medee and
  L'Atalante sediments, the diversity of prokaryotic 16S rDNA sequences contained
  in the extracellular DNA released by virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We found
  that DHAB sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute
  to the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in DHAB sediments
  were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic activities, suggesting that
  extracellular DNA released from killed prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic
  resource for benthic prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained
  novel and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but dissimilar
  from the respective microbial DNA pools. We conclude that the strong viral impact
  in DHAB sediments influences the genetic composition of extracellular DNA, which
  can preserve the signatures of present and past infections. Â© 2014 The Author(s)
