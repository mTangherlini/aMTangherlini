abstract: Â© 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Viruses
  are the most abundant life forms in the world's oceans and they are key drivers
  of biogeochemical cycles, but their impact on the microbial assemblages inhabiting
  hydrothermal vent ecosystems is still largely unknown. Here, we analysed the viral
  life strategies and virus-host interactions in the sediments of a newly discovered
  shallow-water hydrothermal field of the Mediterranean Sea. Our study reveals that
  temperate viruses, once experimentally induced to replicate, can cause large mortality
  of vent microbes, significantly reducing the chemoautotrophic carbon production,
  while enhancing the metabolism of microbial heterotrophs and the re-cycling of the
  organic matter. These results provide new insights on the factors controlling primary
  and secondary production processes in hydrothermal vents, suggesting that the inducible
  provirus-host interactions occurring in these systems can profoundly influence the
  functioning of the microbial food web and the efficiency in the energy transfer
  to the higher trophic levels.
