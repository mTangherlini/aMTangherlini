abstract: Submarine canyons and slopes increase the topographic heterogeneity of continental
  margins and enhance mass and energy transfer from the shelf to the deeper basins,
  profoundly influencing the biodiversity and functioning of deep-sea ecosystems.
  However, information on the distribution and diversity of microbial assemblages
  in such habitats is extremely scant. In the present study, for the first time, we
  investigated abundances of benthic prokaryotes and their diversity (i.e., bacterial
  and archaeal) in two of the largest canyons of the Mediterranean Sea (Bisagno and
  Polcevera Canyons, in the Ligurian Margin) and their adjacent open slope along a
  water-depth gradient from 200 to 2000 m. We found that prokaryotic abundance and
  the richness of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) varied within a narrow range
  despite the high variability of thermohaline and trophic conditions in the habitats
  investigated. Conversely, the taxonomic composition (in terms of OTUs) was highly
  variable among the different habitats and depths investigated. The largest fraction
  of OTUs (representing textgreater80% of the total OTUs identified) were unique of
  each sampling site, indicating a high prokaryotic $Î²$-diversity among the investigated
  systems. Thermo-haline and trophic conditions and water depth only partially influenced
  the composition of the prokaryotic assemblages suggesting that other factors, potentially
  related to physical forcing typically occurring in margin ecosystems, could promote
  a high diversification of benthic bacterial and archaeal assemblages. This study
  provides new insights into the benthic prokaryotic diversity of Ligurian canyons
  and suggests that microbial assemblages thriving in continental margins can largely
  contribute to the whole diversity of Mediterranean deep-sea ecosystems.
