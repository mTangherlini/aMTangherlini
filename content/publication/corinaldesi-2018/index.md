abstract: Extracellular DNA in deep-sea sediments represents a major repository of
  genes, which previously belonged to living organisms. However, the extent to which
  these extracellular genes influence current estimates of prokaryotic biodiversity
  is unknown. We investigated the abundance and diversity of 16S rDNA sequences contained
  within extracellular DNA from continental margins of different biogeographic regions.
  We also compared the taxonomic composition of microbial assemblages through the
  analysis of extracellular DNA and DNA associated with living cells. 16S rDNA contained
  in the extracellular DNA pool contributed up to 50% of the total 16S rDNA copy number
  determined in the sediments. Ca. 4% of extracellular Operational Taxonomic Units
  (OTUs) were shared among the different biogeographic regions revealing the presence
  of a core of preserved OTUs. A higher fraction of OTUs was exclusive of each region
  potentially due to its geographic and thermohaline characteristics. Ca. one third
  of the OTUs identified in the extracellular DNA were absent from living prokaryotic
  assemblages, possibly representing the signatures of past assemblages. Our findings
  expand the knowledge of the contribution of extracellular microbial sequences to
  current estimates of prokaryotic diversity obtained through the analyses of \"environmental
  DNA\", and open new perspectives for understanding microbial successions in benthic
  ecosystems.
