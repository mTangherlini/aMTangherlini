abstract: © 2016 Elsevier Ltd Biotic indices for monitoring marine ecosystems are
  mostly based on the analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Due to their
  high sensitivity to pollution and fast response to environmental changes, bacterial
  assemblages could complement the information provided by benthic metazoan communities
  as indicators of human-induced impacts, but so far, this biological component has
  not been well explored for this purpose. Here we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon
  sequencing to analyze the bacterial assemblage composition of 51 estuarine and coastal
  stations characterized by different environmental conditions and human-derived pressures.
  Using the relative abundance of putative indicator bacterial taxa, we developed
  a biotic index that is significantly correlated with a sediment quality index calculated
  on the basis of organic and inorganic compound concentrations. This new index based
  on bacterial assemblage composition can be a sensitive tool for providing a fast
  environmental assessment and allow a more comprehensive integrative ecosystem approach
  for environmental management.
