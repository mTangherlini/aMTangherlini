abstract: Oceanic trenches at hadal (textgreater6,000 m) depths are hot spots of organic
  matter deposition and mineralization and can host abundant and active bacterial
  assemblages. However, the factors able to shape their biodiversity and functioning
  remain largely unexplored, especially in subsurface sediments. Here, we investigated
  the patterns and drivers of benthic bacterial $α$- and $β$-diversity (i.e., OTU
  richness and turnover diversity) along the vertical profile down to 1.5 m sediment
  depth in the Izu-Bonin Trench (at ̃10,000 m water depth). The protease and glucosidase
  enzymatic activity rates were also determined, as a proxy of organic matter degradation
  potential in the different sediment layers. Molecular fingerprinting based on automated
  ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) indicated that the $α$-diversity of
  bacterial assemblages remained high throughout the vertical profile and that the
  turnover ($β$-) diversity among sediment horizons reached values up to 90% of dissimilarity.
  Multivariate distance-based linear modeling (DISTLM) pointed out that the diversity
  and functioning of the hadal bacterial assemblages were influenced by the variability
  of environmental conditions (including the availability of organic resources and
  electron donors/acceptors) and of viral production rates along the sediment vertical
  profile. Based on our results, we can argue that the heterogeneity of physical-chemical
  features of the hadal sediments of the Izu-Bonin Trench contribute to increase the
  niches availability for different bacterial taxa, while viruses contribute to maintain
  high levels of bacterial turnover diversity and to enhance organic matter cycling
  in these extremely remote and isolated ecosystems.
