abstract: Metagenomic sequencing of nucleic acids from environmental or other complex
  samples can be successfully used as a powerful tool for environmental quality assessment.
  Being a culture-independent approach, it does not rely on the presence or absence
  of specific organisms or genes, and can even identify novel organisms. When focused
  on viruses, metagenomics can help to shed light on their involvement in ecosystem
  functioning, due to their dependence on their hosts and their ability to respond
  quickly to environmental changes. Moreover, viral metagenomics can show the impact
  of contamination on different natural ecosystems, highlighting putative sources
  and potential pathogens. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
