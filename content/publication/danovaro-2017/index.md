abstract: © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights
  reserved. Submarine volcanic eruptions are major catastrophic events that allow
  investigation of the colonization mechanisms of newly formed seabed. We explored
  the seafloor after the eruption of the Tagoro submarine volcano off El Hierro Island,
  Canary Archipelago. Near the summit of the volcanic cone, at about 130 m depth,
  we found massive mats of long, white filaments that we named Venus's hair. Microscopic
  and molecular analyses revealed that these filaments are made of bacterial trichomes
  enveloped within a sheath and colonized by epibiotic bacteria. Metagenomic analyses
  of the filaments identified a new genus and species of the order Thiotrichales,
  Thiolava veneris. Venus's hair shows an unprecedented array of metabolic pathways,
  spanning from the exploitation of organic and inorganic carbon released by volcanic
  degassing to the uptake of sulfur and nitrogen compounds. This unique metabolic
  plasticity provides key competitive advantages for the colonization of the new habitat
  created by the submarine eruption. A specialized and highly diverse food web thrives
  on the complex three-dimensional habitat formed by these microorganisms, providing
  evidence that Venus's hair can drive the restart of biological systems after submarine
  volcanic eruptions.
