abstract: Â© 2017 The Author(s). Viruses are the most abundant and, likely, one of
  the most diverse biological components in the oceans. By infecting their hosts,
  they play key roles in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning at a global
  scale. The ocean interior hosts most of the microbial life, and, despite deep-sea
  sediments represent the main repository of this component and the largest biome
  on Earth, viral diversity in these ecosystems remains almost completely unknown.
  We compared a physical-chemical procedure and a previously published sediment washing-based
  procedure for isolating viruses from benthic deep-sea ecosystems to generate viromes
  through high-throughput sequencing. The procedure based on a physical-chemical dislodgment
  of viral particles from the sediments, followed by vacuum filtration was much more
  efficient allowing us to recover  textgreater 85% of the extractable viruses. By
  using this procedure, a high fraction of viral DNA was recovered and new viromes
  from different benthic deep-sea sites were generated. Such viromes were diversified
  in terms of both viral families and putative functions. Overall, the results presented
  here provide new insights for evaluating benthic deep-sea viral diversity through
  metagenomic analyses, and reveal that deep-sea sediments are a hot spot of novel
  viral genotypes and functions.
