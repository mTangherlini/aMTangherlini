abstract: Deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) are considered to be among the
  most extreme ecosystems on our planet, allowing only the life of polyextremophilic
  organisms. DHABs' prokaryotes exhibit extraordinary metabolic capabilities, representing
  a hot topic for microbiologists and biotechnologists. These are a source of enzymes
  and new secondary metabolites with valuable applications in different biotechnological
  fields. Here, we review the current knowledge on prokaryotic diversity in DHABs,
  highlighting the biotechnological applications of identified taxa and isolated species.
  The discovery of new species and molecules from these ecosystems is expanding our
  understanding of life limits and is expected to have a strong impact on biotechnological
  applications.
