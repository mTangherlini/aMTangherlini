abstract: One of Saturn's largest moons, Enceladus, possesses a vast extraterrestrial
  ocean (i.e., exo-ocean) that is increasingly becoming the hotspot of future research
  initiatives dedicated to the exploration of putative life. Here, a new bio-exploration
  concept design for Enceladus' exo-ocean is proposed, focusing on the potential presence
  of organisms across a wide range of sizes (i.e., from uni- to multicellular and
  animal-like), according to state-of-the-art sensor and robotic platform technologies
  used in terrestrial deep-sea research. In particular, we focus on combined direct
  and indirect life-detection capabilities, based on optoacoustic imaging and passive
  acoustics, as well as molecular approaches. Such biologically oriented sampling
  can be accompanied by concomitant geochemical and oceanographic measurements to
  provide data relevant to exo-ocean exploration and understanding. Finally, we describe
  how this multidisciplinary monitoring approach is currently enabled in terrestrial
  oceans through cabled (fixed) observatories and their related mobile multiparametric
  platforms (i.e., Autonomous Underwater and Remotely Operated Vehicles, as well as
  crawlers, rovers, and biomimetic robots) and how their modified design can be used
  for exo-ocean exploration.
