abstract: Viruses are the most abundant biological entities throughout marine and
  terrestrial ecosystems, but little is known about virus-mineral interactions or
  the potential for virus preservation in the geological record. Here we use contextual
  metagenomic data and microscopic analyses to show that viruses occur in high diversity
  within a modern lacustrine microbial mat, and vastly outnumber prokaryotes and other
  components of the microbial mat. Experimental data reveal that mineral precipitation
  takes place directly on free viruses and, as a result of viral infections, on cell
  debris resulting from cell lysis. Viruses are initially permineralized by amorphous
  magnesium silicates, which then alter to magnesium carbonate nanospheres of ∼80-200
  nm in diameter during diagenesis. Our findings open up the possibility to investigate
  the evolution and geological history of viruses and their role in organomineralization,
  as well as providing an alternative explanation for enigmatic carbonate nanospheres
  previously observed in the geological record. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
