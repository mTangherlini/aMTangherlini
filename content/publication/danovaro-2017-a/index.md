abstract: Â© 2017 Danovaro R et al. Global change is altering oceanic temperature,
  salinity, pH, and oxygen concentration, directly and indirectly influencing marine
  microbial food web structure and function. As microbes represent  textgreater 90%
  of the ocean's biomass and are major drivers of biogeochemical cycles, understanding
  their responses to such changes is fundamental for predicting the consequences of
  global change on ecosystem functioning. Recent findings indicate that marine archaea
  and archaeal viruses are active and relevant components of marine microbial assemblages,
  far more abundant and diverse than was previously thought. Further research is urgently
  needed to better understand the impacts of global change on virus-archaea dynamics
  and how archaea and their viruses can interactively influence the ocean's feedbacks
  on global change.
