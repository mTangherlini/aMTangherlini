abstract: Bursting bubbles at the ocean-surface produce airborne salt-water spray-droplets,
  in turn, forming climate-cooling marine haze and cloud layers. The reflectance and
  ultimate cooling effect of these layers is determined by the spray's water-uptake
  properties that are modified through entrainment of ocean-surface organic matter
  (OM) into the airborne droplets. We present new results illustrating a clear dependence
  of OM mass-fraction enrichment in sea spray (OM ss) on both phytoplankton-biomass,
  determined from Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). The correlation
  coefficient for OM ss as a function of Chl-a increased form 0.67 on a daily timescale
  to 0.85 on a monthly timescale. An even stronger correlation was found as a function
  of NPP, increasing to 0.93 on a monthly timescale. We suggest the observed dependence
  is through the demise of the bloom, driven by nanoscale biological processes (such
  as viral infections), releasing large quantities of transferable OM comprising cell
  debris, exudates and other colloidal materials. This OM, through aggregation processes,
  leads to enrichment in sea-spray, thus demonstrating an important coupling between
  biologically-driven plankton bloom termination, marine productivity and sea-spray
  modification with potentially significant climate impacts.
