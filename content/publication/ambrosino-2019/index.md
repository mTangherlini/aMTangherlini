abstract: The sea represents a major source of biodiversity. It exhibits many different
  ecosystems in a huge variety of environmental conditions where marine organisms
  have evolved with extensive diversification of structures and functions, making
  the marine environment a treasure trove of molecules with potential for biotechnological
  applications and innovation in many different areas. Rapid progress of the omics
  sciences has revealed novel opportunities to advance the knowledge of biological
  systems, paving the way for an unprecedented revolution in the field and expanding
  marine research from model organisms to an increasing number of marine species.
  Multi-level approaches based on molecular investigations at genomic, metagenomic,
  transcriptomic, metatranscriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels are essential
  to discover marine resources and further explore key molecular processes involved
  in their production and action. As a consequence, omics approaches, accompanied
  by the associated bioinformatic resources and computational tools for molecular
  analyses and modeling, are boosting the rapid advancement of biotechnologies. In
  this review, we provide an overview of the most relevant bioinformatic resources
  and major approaches, highlighting perspectives and bottlenecks for an appropriate
  exploitation of these opportunities for biotechnology applications from marine resources.
