abstract: Deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) are one of the most hostile environments
  on Earth. Even though DHABs have hypersaline conditions, anoxia and high hydrostatic
  pressure, they host incredible microbial biodiversity. Among eukaryotes inhabiting
  these systems, recent studies demonstrated that fungi are a quantitatively relevant
  component. Here, fungi can benefit from the accumulation of large amounts of organic
  material. Marine fungi are also known to produce bioactive molecules. In particular,
  halophilic and halotolerant fungi are a reservoir of enzymes and secondary metabolites
  with valuable applications in industrial, pharmaceutical, and environmental biotechnology.
  Here we report that among the fungal taxa identified from the Mediterranean and
  Red Sea DHABs, halotolerant halophilic species belonging to the genera Aspergillus
  and Penicillium can be used or screened for enzymes and bioactive molecules. Fungi
  living in DHABs can extend our knowledge about the limits of life, and the discovery
  of new species and molecules from these environments can have high biotechnological
  potential.
