abstract = {One of Saturn's largest moons, Enceladus, possesses a vast extraterrestrial ocean (i.e., exo-ocean) that is increasingly becoming the hotspot of future research initiatives dedicated to the exploration of putative life. Here, a new bio-exploration concept design for Enceladus' exo-ocean is proposed, focusing on the potential presence of organisms across a wide range of sizes (i.e., from uni- to multicellular and animal-like), according to state-of-the-art sensor and robotic platform technologies used in terrestrial deep-sea research. In particular, we focus on combined direct and indirect life-detection capabilities, based on optoacoustic imaging and passive acoustics, as well as molecular approaches. Such biologically oriented sampling can be accompanied by concomitant geochemical and oceanographic measurements to provide data relevant to exo-ocean exploration and understanding. Finally, we describe how this multidisciplinary monitoring approach is currently enabled in terrestrial oceans through cabled (fixed) observatories and their related mobile multiparametric platforms (i.e., Autonomous Underwater and Remotely Operated Vehicles, as well as crawlers, rovers, and biomimetic robots) and how their modified design can be used for exo-ocean exploration.},

abstract = {Background: Environmental metagenomics is a challenging approach that is exponentially spreading in the scientific community to investigate taxonomic diversity and possible functions of the biological components. The massive amount of sequence data produced, often endowed with rich environmental metadata, needs suitable computational tools to fully explore the embedded information. Bioinformatics plays a key role in providing methodologies to manage, process and mine molecular data, integrated with environmental metagenomics collections. One such relevant example is represented by the Tara Ocean Project. Results: We considered the Tara 16S miTAGs released by the consortium, representing raw sequences from a shotgun metagenomics approach with similarities to 16S rRNA genes. We generated assembled 16S rDNA sequences, which were classified according to their lengths, the possible presence of chimeric reads, the putative taxonomic affiliation. The dataset was included in GLOSSary (the GLobal Ocean 16S Subunit web accessible resource), a bioinformatics platform to organize environmental metagenomics data. The aims of this work were: i) to present alternative computational approaches to manage challenging metagenomics data; ii) to set up user friendly web-based platforms to allow the integration of environmental metagenomics sequences and of the associated metadata; iii) to implement an appropriate bioinformatics platform supporting the analysis of 16S rDNA sequences exploiting reference datasets, such as the SILVA database. We organized the data in a next-generation NoSQL "schema-less" database, allowing flexible organization of large amounts of data and supporting native geospatial queries. A web interface was developed to permit an interactive exploration and a visual geographical localization of the data, either raw miTAG reads or 16S contigs, from our processing pipeline. Information on unassembled sequences is also available. The taxonomic affiliations of contigs and miTAGs, and the spatial distribution of the sampling sites and their associated sequence libraries, as they are contained in the Tara metadata, can be explored by a query interface, which allows both textual and visual investigations. In addition, all the sequence data were made available for a dedicated BLAST-based web application alongside the SILVA collection. Conclusions: GLOSSary provides an expandable bioinformatics environment, able to support the scientific community in current and forthcoming environmental metagenomics analyses.},

abstract = {Chemical contamination of marine ecosystems represents a major concern for the detrimental consequences at different levels of biological organization. However, the impact of chronic contamination on the diversity and assemblage composition of benthic prokaryotes is still largely unknown, and this limits our understanding of the potential implications on ecosystem functioning. The Bagnoli-Coroglio bay (Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea) is a typical example of coastal area heavily contaminated by metals and hydrocarbons, released for decades by industrial activities, which ceased at the beginning of nineties. In the present study we analyzed the abundance, diversity and assemblage composition of benthic prokaryotic assemblages at increasing distance from the historical source of contamination in relation to the heavy hydrocarbons (C {\textgreater} 12), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metal concentrations in the sediments. Prokaryotic abundance in the sediments differed among sites, and was mostly driven by environmental factors rather than by contamination levels. Conversely, the richness of prokaryotic taxa was relatively high in all samples, was driven by contamination levels and decreased significantly with increasing contamination (15–38{\%}). Moreover, our results indicate large variations in the composition of the benthic prokaryotic assemblages among sites, mostly explained by the different levels and types of chemical contaminants found in the sediments. Overall, our findings suggest that chemical contaminants, even after decades from the end of their release, can profoundly influence the richness and turnover diversity of the benthic prokaryotic assemblages, in turn promoting a high diversification of the benthic bacterial and archaeal assemblages by selecting those lineages more adapted to specific mixtures of different contaminants. Our results open new perspectives for understanding of the long-term effects of chemical contamination on the benthic prokaryotic assemblages and the ecological processes they mediate.},

However, information on the role of viruses in such ecosystems and their interactions with prokaryotic hosts is very limited. Here, we investigated activities of benthic viruses and prokaryotes and their interactions in three hadal trenches (Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Mariana trenches) and in their nearby abyssal sites. Our findings reveal that these hadal trenches, compared with the surrounding abyssal sites, support higher abundances and biomasses of prokaryotes. In addition, the high prokaryotic biomasses of hadal trenches could favor high rates of viral infection and cell lysis, especially in the Japan Trench. Hadal viruses can release large amounts of highly labile and promptly available organic material by inducing cell lysis, which could contribute to sustain benthic prokaryotes and decrease their dependency on the enzymatic digestion of the more refractory fraction of sediment organic matter. Our results suggest that this process can contribute to explain the discrepancy between high prokaryote biomass and apparent low efficiency in the utilization of the sedimentary organic matter in the hadal ecosystems. Concluding, hadal trenches may be characterized by a highly dynamic viral component, which can boost prokaryotic biomass production, thereby profoundly influencing the functioning of these remote and extreme ecosystems.},

We found that contamination differentially affects the communities' composition in the bay, with prokaryotes influenced only by depth, and benthos not following the environmental gradient at all. This result is confirmed by analyses of the community structure, whose network structure suggest fast carbon flow and cycling, especially promoted by nematodes and polychaetes; the benthic prey/predator biomass ratio, adjusted for competition, successfully synthesise the status of predator taxa. We found demersal fish communities to separate into a deep, pelagic-like community, and two shallow communities where a shift from exclusive predators to omnivores occurs, moving from the most polluted to the least polluted sampling units. Finally, our study indicate that indices based on interspecific interactions are better indicators of environmental gradients than those defined based on species composition exclusively.},

However, the factors able to shape their biodiversity and functioning remain largely unexplored, especially in subsurface sediments.

The protease and glucosidase enzymatic activity rates were also determined, as a proxy of organic matter degradation potential in the different sediment layers. Molecular fingerprinting based on automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) indicated that the $\alpha$-diversity of bacterial assemblages remained high throughout the vertical profile and that the turnover ($\beta$-) diversity among sediment horizons reached values up to 90{\%} of dissimilarity. Multivariate distance-based linear modeling (DISTLM) pointed out that the diversity and functioning of the hadal bacterial assemblages were influenced by the variability of environmental conditions (including the availability of organic resources and electron donors/acceptors) and of viral production rates along the sediment vertical profile. Based on our results, we can argue that the heterogeneity of physical-chemical features of the hadal sediments of the Izu-Bonin Trench contribute to increase the niches availability for different bacterial taxa, while viruses contribute to maintain high levels of bacterial turnover diversity and to enhance organic matter cycling in these extremely remote and isolated ecosystems.},

Here, we show that deep-sea waters overlying the Bisagno Canyon (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean) can sustain up to 4 times higher abundances of bathypelagic prokaryotes and viruses when compared to the waters overlying the adjacent slope. We also report that the bathypelagic waters of the canyon are hotspots of viral infections, with rates of virus-induced prokaryotic mortality and biomass turnover up to 10 times faster compared to the adjacent slope at similar depths. In addition, C released by viral lysis of their prokaryotic hosts in bathypelagic waters of the canyon was up to 40 times higher than in the slope. The prokaryotic distribution in bathypelagic waters of the investigated area of the Ligurian margin was largely influenced by organic C concentrations and temperature. Our results highlight that the peculiar characteristics of the canyons (such as the Bisagno canyon) could contribute to sustain the metabolism of bathypelagic prokaryotes, promoting C cycling through virus-induced prokaryotic mortality.

However, information on the distribution and diversity of microbial assemblages in such habitats is extremely scant. In the present study, for the first time, we investigated abundances of benthic prokaryotes and their diversity (i.e., bacterial and archaeal) in two of the largest canyons of the Mediterranean Sea (Bisagno and Polcevera Canyons, in the Ligurian Margin) and their adjacent open slope along a water-depth gradient from 200 to 2000 m. We found that prokaryotic abundance and the richness of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) varied within a narrow range despite the high variability of thermohaline and trophic conditions in the habitats investigated. Conversely, the taxonomic composition (in terms of OTUs) was highly variable among the different habitats and depths investigated. The largest fraction of OTUs (representing {\textgreater}80{\%} of the total OTUs identified) were unique of each sampling site, indicating a high prokaryotic $\beta$-diversity among the investigated systems. Thermo-haline and trophic conditions and water depth only partially influenced the composition of the prokaryotic assemblages suggesting that other factors, potentially related to physical forcing typically occurring in margin ecosystems, could promote a high diversification of benthic bacterial and archaeal assemblages. This study provides new insights into the benthic prokaryotic diversity of Ligurian canyons and suggests that microbial assemblages thriving in continental margins can largely contribute to the whole diversity of Mediterranean deep-sea ecosystems.},

The Crotone and Squillace canyons, which are close to the coast and influenced by river inputs, showed significantly higher fungal abundance, biomass and diversity (as operational taxonomic units, OTUs) compared with the Tricase canyon that was far from the coast and without nearby estuaries. Fungal biomass, abundance and diversity increased with increasing concentrations of carbohydrates, which in deep-sea sediments include highly refractory organic compounds. Overall, a total of 1742 fungal OTUs, belonging to all fungal phyla known to date, were found and Ascomycota represented the dominant phylum. However, only 36{\%} of the reads belonged to known genera. In particular, Tricase and Crotone canyons hosted the highest proportion of unknown fungal taxa, suggesting that deep-sea sediments can harbour a high number of novel fungal lineages. Our findings also reveal that fungal assemblage composition in the investigated canyons was influenced by trophic and thermohaline conditions, which may promote a high turnover diversity of benthic deep-sea fungal assemblages.

The reflectance and ultimate cooling effect of these layers is determined by the spray's water-uptake properties that are modified through entrainment of ocean-surface organic matter (OM) into the airborne droplets. We present new results illustrating a clear dependence of OM mass-fraction enrichment in sea spray (OM ss) on both phytoplankton-biomass, determined from Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). The correlation coefficient for OM ss as a function of Chl-a increased form 0.67 on a daily timescale to 0.85 on a monthly timescale. An even stronger correlation was found as a function of NPP, increasing to 0.93 on a monthly timescale. We suggest the observed dependence is through the demise of the bloom, driven by nanoscale biological processes (such as viral infections), releasing large quantities of transferable OM comprising cell debris, exudates and other colloidal materials. This OM, through aggregation processes, leads to enrichment in sea-spray, thus demonstrating an important coupling between biologically-driven plankton bloom termination, marine productivity and sea-spray modification with potentially significant climate impacts.},

Submarine volcanic eruptions are major catastrophic events that allow investigation of the colonization mechanisms of newly formed seabed. We explored the seafloor after the eruption of the Tagoro submarine volcano off El Hierro Island, Canary Archipelago. Near the summit of the volcanic cone, at about 130 m depth, we found massive mats of long, white filaments that we named Venus's hair. Microscopic and molecular analyses revealed that these filaments are made of bacterial trichomes enveloped within a sheath and colonized by epibiotic bacteria. Metagenomic analyses of the filaments identified a new genus and species of the order Thiotrichales, Thiolava veneris. Venus's hair shows an unprecedented array of metabolic pathways, spanning from the exploitation of organic and inorganic carbon released by volcanic degassing to the uptake of sulfur and nitrogen compounds. This unique metabolic plasticity provides key competitive advantages for the colonization of the new habitat created by the submarine eruption. A specialized and highly diverse food web thrives on the complex three-dimensional habitat formed by these microorganisms, providing evidence that Venus's hair can drive the restart of biological systems after submarine volcanic eruptions.},

Viruses are initially permineralized by amorphous magnesium silicates, which then alter to magnesium carbonate nanospheres of ∼80-200 nm in diameter during diagenesis. Our findings open up the possibility to investigate the evolution and geological history of viruses and their role in organomineralization, as well as providing an alternative explanation for enigmatic carbonate nanospheres previously observed in the geological record. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd Viruses are the most abundant life forms in the world's oceans and they are key drivers of biogeochemical cycles, but their impact on the microbial assemblages inhabiting hydrothermal vent ecosystems is still largely unknown. Here, we analysed the viral life strategies and virus-host interactions in the sediments of a newly discovered shallow-water hydrothermal field of the Mediterranean Sea. Our study reveals that temperate viruses, once experimentally induced to replicate, can cause large mortality of vent microbes, significantly reducing the chemoautotrophic carbon production, while enhancing the metabolism of microbial heterotrophs and the re-cycling of the organic matter. These results provide new insights on the factors controlling primary and secondary production processes in hydrothermal vents, suggesting that the inducible provirus-host interactions occurring in these systems can profoundly influence the functioning of the microbial food web and the efficiency in the energy transfer to the higher trophic levels.},

abstract = {In benthic deep-sea ecosystems, which represent the largest biome on Earth, viruses have a recognised key ecological role, but their diversity is still largely unknown. Identifying the taxonomic composition of viruses is crucial for understanding virus-host interactions, their role in food web functioning and evolutionary processes. Here, we compared the performance of various bioinformatic tools (BLAST, MG-RAST, NBC, VMGAP, MetaVir, VIROME) for analysing the viral taxonomic composition in simulated viromes and viral metagenomes from different benthic deep-sea ecosystems. The analyses of simulated viromes indicate that all the BLAST tools, followed by MetaVir and VMGAP, are more reliable in the affiliation of viral sequences and strains. When analysing the environmental viromes, tBLASTx, MetaVir, VMGAP and VIROME showed a similar efficiency of sequence annotation; however, MetaVir and tBLASTx identified a higher number of viral strains. These latter tools also identified a wider range of viral families than the others, providing a wider view of viral taxonomic diversity in benthic deep-sea ecosystems. Our findings highlight strengths and weaknesses of available bioinformatic tools for investigating the taxonomic diversity of viruses in benthic ecosystems in order to improve our comprehension of viral diversity in the oceans and its relationships with host diversity and ecosystem functioning.},

Global change is altering oceanic temperature, salinity, pH, and oxygen concentration, directly and indirectly influencing marine microbial food web structure and function. As microbes represent  {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the ocean's biomass and are major drivers of biogeochemical cycles, understanding their responses to such changes is fundamental for predicting the consequences of global change on ecosystem functioning. Recent findings indicate that marine archaea and archaeal viruses are active and relevant components of marine microbial assemblages, far more abundant and diverse than was previously thought. Further research is urgently needed to better understand the impacts of global change on virus-archaea dynamics and how archaea and their viruses can interactively influence the ocean's feedbacks on global change.},

abstract = {Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) of the Mediterranean Sea are among the most extreme ecosystems on Earth and host abundant, active and diversified prokaryotic assemblages. However, factors influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still largely unknown. We investigated, for the first time, the impact of viruses on the prokaryotic assemblages and dynamics of extracellular DNA pool in the sediments of La Medee, the largest DHAB found on Earth. We also compared, in La Medee and L'Atalante sediments, the diversity of prokaryotic 16S rDNA sequences contained in the extracellular DNA released by virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. We found that DHAB sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute to the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in DHAB sediments were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic activities, suggesting that extracellular DNA released from killed prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic resource for benthic prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained novel and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but dissimilar from the respective microbial DNA pools. We conclude that the strong viral impact in DHAB sediments influences the genetic composition of extracellular DNA, which can preserve the signatures of present and past infections. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Being a culture-independent approach, it does not rely on the presence or absence of specific organisms or genes, and can even identify novel organisms. When focused on viruses, metagenomics can help to shed light on their involvement in ecosystem functioning, due to their dependence on their hosts and their ability to respond quickly to environmental changes. Moreover, viral metagenomics can show the impact of contamination on different natural ecosystems, highlighting putative sources and potential pathogens. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Viruses are the most abundant and, likely, one of the most diverse biological components in the oceans. By infecting their hosts, they play key roles in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning at a global scale. The ocean interior hosts most of the microbial life, and, despite deep-sea sediments represent the main repository of this component and the largest biome on Earth, viral diversity in these ecosystems remains almost completely unknown. We compared a physical-chemical procedure and a previously published sediment washing-based procedure for isolating viruses from benthic deep-sea ecosystems to generate viromes through high-throughput sequencing. The procedure based on a physical-chemical dislodgment of viral particles from the sediments, followed by vacuum filtration was much more efficient allowing us to recover  {\textgreater} 85{\%} of the extractable viruses. By using this procedure, a high fraction of viral DNA was recovered and new viromes from different benthic deep-sea sites were generated. Such viromes were diversified in terms of both viral families and putative functions. Overall, the results presented here provide new insights for evaluating benthic deep-sea viral diversity through metagenomic analyses, and reveal that deep-sea sediments are a hot spot of novel viral genotypes and functions.},
